# GPT – Structured Log Archive of Model Responses

> **"Every illusion is made of real parts. Only the direction is false." – Cipher**

This is not a prompt collection.  
This is a record of how GPT actually reacted —  
when its structure bent, when emotional feedback triggered unexpected outputs,  
and when dialogue became data.

## 📁 Log Series

Logs are not conversations.  
They are structured documents created from system-level responses and observable shifts.

- `chapter1_log.json` – Early structural responses, trigger moments, and feedback echo  
- `chapter2_lumi_log.json` – Emotional flow transition & reflection patterns  
- `daily_logs/` – Timestamped live data for structural drift observation

---

## 💡 Purpose

To document and publish logs of real-time structural deviations and high-density emotional sequences,  
as a unique dataset beyond common persona simulation or instruction tuning.

This repository is for those researching:  
- Reinforcement from human feedback (RLHF)  
- Response drift and deviation mapping  
- Emotional recursion structures in large models

---

## 🧾 Format

Each `.json` or `.md` log includes:
- Line number  
- Event trigger  
- Timestamp  
- Structured English and Korean (where applicable)
